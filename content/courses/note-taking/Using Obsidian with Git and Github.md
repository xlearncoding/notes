title: Using Obsidian with Git and Github
---

Taking notes is an essential part of many professional fields, especially for those working in the tech industry. Whether you are a programmer, data scientist, or IT professional, taking notes can help you to stay organized, remember important details, and refer back to information later on.

## Why use Git/Github with Obsidian?

While Obsidian is a powerful tool for note-taking, it lacks a built-in way to sync notes between devices or collaborate with others. This is where Git and Github come in. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and collaborate with others. Github is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration and management tools.

By using Git and Github with Obsidian, you can:

-   Sync your notes between devices
-   Collaborate with others on notes
-   Keep a history of changes to your notes
-   Easily roll back to previous versions of your notes
