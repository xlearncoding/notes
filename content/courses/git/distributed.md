"distributed" refers to the fact that every user who clones a git [[repository]] has a complete copy of the entire [[repository]], including its full history of changes. This means that there is no central server that holds the "official" version of the [[repository]], and all users have equal access to the same set of files and version history.

Each user's local copy of the [[repository]] can be modified independently, and changes can be shared between different copies of the [[repository]] using git's distributed version control system. Users can push their changes to other users' repositories, and pull changes made by others back into their own local copy.
