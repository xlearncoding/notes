title: Basic git terminology
---
Although I will provide you with some basic Git terminology here, it can be challenging to fully comprehend these terms without any practical experience. Therefore, I suggest you read this section to get a general idea rather than attempting to understand everything in detail.

> **Repository:** A repository is a collection of files and directories that are tracked by Git.

> **Commit:** A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit represents a set of changes to the files in the repository.

> **Branch:** A branch is a separate line of development in the repository. Each branch can have its own set of changes and commits, allowing multiple people to work on different features or fixes independently.

> **Merge:** Merging is the process of combining two or more branches of development back into a single branch. This is typically done when a feature or fix is complete and ready to be integrated into the main branch.

> **Pull:** Pulling is the process of retrieving changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.

> **Push:** Pushing is the process of sending your local changes to a remote repository, so that they can be shared with others.

> **Clone:** Cloning is the process of creating a local copy of a remote repository on your machine, so that you can work on it locally.

> **Remote:** A remote is a reference to a remote repository, such as one hosted on GitHub or GitLab.

> **Fork:** Forking is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository on a different account or organization. This allows you to make changes to the repository independently of the original repository, and to submit pull requests back to the original repository if desired.
