![Linus Torvalds](courses/git/linus.jpeg)

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system used to manage changes to software code. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, and has since become one of the most widely used version control systems in software development. 

Git tracks changes to files over time, allowing developers to collaborate on a project without overwriting each other's work. Git also provides a history of changes, making it easy to revert to an earlier version of code if necessary. Git operates locally on a user's computer, but can also be used to manage remote repositories, allowing teams of developers to work together on the same codebase. 

Overall, Git is an essential tool for modern software development and is widely used by developers and organizations of all sizes.



> **Fun fact:** Linus Torvalds named Git after himself, as he has a tendency to name his projects after himself, and the word "get." According to Torvalds, the name Git was chosen because it was short, easy to remember, and distinct from other software tools. In a 2007 mailing list post, he described himself as an "egotistical bastard" who likes to name his projects after himself, just like he did with Linux. Despite its somewhat humorous origin, Git has become a vital tool for software development, with its use now widespread among developers and organizations alike.
