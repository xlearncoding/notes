From syntax rules to programming concepts and best practices, there's a lot to keep track of. That's where note-taking comes in. By taking notes, you can improve your retention of information, stay organized, and enhance your understanding of programming concepts.\n\n[[courses/git/Mini Course git|Mini Course: git]]\n\n### Benefits of note-taking when learning programming\n\n1. Improved retention of information: When you take notes while learning programming, you're actively engaging with the material. This active engagement helps you remember the information better, which can improve your performance when it comes to applying programming concepts in real-world scenarios.\n\n2. Increased understanding of programming concepts: By taking notes, you're not only memorizing information, but you're also synthesizing it into your own words. This process can help you better understand programming concepts, as you're translating the information into a format that makes sense to you.\n\n3. Organization of information: Programming involves a lot of details, and it can be easy to get overwhelmed with information overload. By taking notes, you can organize the information in a way that makes sense to you. This can help you stay on track with your learning and make it easier to find information when you need it.\n\n### Benefits of using Obsidian for note-taking\n\nObsidian is a note-taking app that's designed for creating interconnected notes. It's especially useful for programmers who want to organize their notes in a way that reflects the relationships between different concepts. Here are some benefits of using Obsidian for note-taking when learning programming:\n\n1. Interconnected notes for better understanding: Obsidian allows you to create links between notes, which can help you see the relationships between different programming concepts. This can help you better understand how different concepts fit together and how they relate to each other.\n\n2. Customizable templates for consistent note-taking: Consistent note-taking is essential for staying organized when learning programming. Obsidian allows you to create customizable templates, which can help you keep your notes organized and consistent.\n\n3. Tagging and search functionality for easy retrieval of information: As your notes grow, it can be difficult to find the information you need. Obsidian allows you to tag notes and use search functionality to quickly find the information you need.\n\n### Benefits of using Git/Github for note-taking\n\nGit and Github are version control tools that are commonly used by programmers. While they're not traditional note-taking tools, they can be useful for organizing your notes when learning programming. Here are some benefits of using Git/Github for note-taking:\n\n1. Version control for tracking changes: When you're learning programming, you'll likely be making a lot of changes to your code and notes. Git allows you to track changes, so you can easily revert to previous versions if needed.\n\n2. Collaboration and sharing: Github allows you to share your notes with others, which can be helpful when you're collaborating on a programming project. You can also use Github to contribute to open-source projects and learn from other programmers.\n\n3. Backup and syncing: Git/Github allows you to backup your notes and sync them across devices. This can be useful for keeping your notes organized and accessible, even if you switch devices or lose your notes.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-03T16:43:52.41045667Z","tags":[]},"/courses/note-taking/Note-taking-with-Obsidian":{"title":"Note-taking with Obsidian","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-03T16:43:52.41045667Z","tags":[]},"/courses/note-taking/Using-Obsidian-with-Git-and-Github":{"title":"Using Obsidian with Git and Github","content":"\nTaking notes is an essential part of many professional fields, especially for those working in the tech industry. Whether you are a programmer, data scientist, or IT professional, taking notes can help you to stay organized, remember important details, and refer back to information later on.\n\n## Why use Git/Github with Obsidian?\n\nWhile Obsidian is a powerful tool for note-taking, it lacks a built-in way to sync notes between devices or collaborate with others. This is where Git and Github come in. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and collaborate with others. Github is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration and management tools.\n\nBy using Git and Github with Obsidian, you can:\n\n-   Sync your notes between devices\n-   Collaborate with others on notes\n-   Keep a history of changes to your notes\n-   Easily roll back to previous versions of your notes\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-03T16:43:52.41045667Z","tags":[]},"/templates/courses/Free-Course-Benefits-of-note-taking":{"title":"Free Course Benefits of note-taking","content":"* [[courses/note-taking/Free Course Benefits of note-taking|Free Course: Benefits of note-taking]]\n\t* [[Note-taking with Obsidian]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-03T16:43:52.41045667Z","tags":[]},"/templates/courses/Mini-Course-git":{"title":"Mini Course git","content":"[[courses/git/Mini Course git|Mini Course: git]]\n* Introduction\n\t- [[courses/git/What is git?|What is git?]]\n\t*  [[courses/git/Why is git important?|Why is git important?]]\n\t * [[courses/git/Basic git terminology|Basic git terminology]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-03T16:43:52.41045667Z","tags":[]}}
